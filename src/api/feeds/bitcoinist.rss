										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not without it&#8217;s hiccups, Nike has formally announced it&#8217;s first &#8220;native web3 sneaker&#8221; this week, courtesy of it&#8217;s NFT / web3 arm, RTFKT. Now, as the industry leader in the sneaker game continues to show investment in building it&#8217;s infrastructure in emerging technology and web3-related fields, it&#8217;s also proving that the audience is rigid&#8230; and <em>global</em>.</p>
<p>The biggest bite back around Nike&#8217;s release has less to do with cost, and much more to do with access, as Nike has restricted fulfillment for it&#8217;s web3 sneakers to U.S.-based addresses only. Let&#8217;s take a look at all you need to know about Nike&#8217;s new release, and the feedback surrounding it.</p>
Nike &amp; RTFKT: How It Came To Be
<p>Nike&#8217;s acquisition of RTFKT last year has largely served as the most successful case study from a traditional brand utilizing an NFT platform &#8211; certainly among those who have entered the NFT space with a longer time horizon.</p>
<p>The acquisition came <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nike-acquires-nft-fashion-startup-rtfkt/">one year ago</a> in the midst of NFT bull market madness. Following the acquisition, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nike-launches-latest-web3-platform-swoosh/">the brand launched their own dedicated web3 platform, .Swoosh, last month as well</a>, showing a continued investment to play in the web3 sandbox.</p>
<p>From the outside looking in, it seems that Nike has largely left RTFKT to operate on it&#8217;s own accord in spearheading projects, but it&#8217;s come generally as a massive success. In August, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nike-makes-record-185-million-nft-sales/">we covered how Nike was the far-and-away leader</a> in big box brands when it comes to NFT engagement strategy &#8211; and no one&#8217;s come close to the crown in recent months, either.</p>

The Sneaker Drop Debate Boils Down To Geographical Limitations
<p>The announcement Twitter thread from RTFKT, released on Monday, details some of what can be expected, including a &#8216;walk-to-earn&#8217; mechanic, utility via authenticity, app connectivity, and more:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p></p>
<p>However, the thread closes with a key note that has caused a lot of friction: &#8220;Due to advanced tech and product regulation, product can ONLY be shipped to US.&#8221; The lack of clarity &#8211; and lack of foresight in not sharing this pertinent detail until after outside U.S. money has been contributed to the project &#8211; has led to an abundance of criticism around another brand with web3 visions, and web2 execution. The MONOLITH price dropped substantially, recording averages north of 1.5ETH in recent days, and now recording sales for less than 0.5 ETH today.</p>
<p>Crypto is a global affair, and the feedback and responses around this point just drives that home so much more. For big brands, it continues to be a trudge through the mud it getting it done right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The controversial taxes slapped on crypto transactions in India have continued to create a <a href="https://www.internationaltaxreview.com/article/2aubz4iwirgo9jk0avwg0/this-week-in-tax-indias-crypto-tax-may-kill-the-industry#:~:text=The%20Indian%20government%20has%20imposed,into%20effect%20from%20July%202022." target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative ripple effect</a>. Earlier this year, the Indian Parliament passed this controversial tax proposal which came into effect on April 1.</p>
<p>The bill met resistance at the initial session in the lower house, with over 20 members saying it could eventually destroy the industry. However, since the bill&#8217;s implementation, crypto associations and individuals have groaned under its weight.</p>
<p>More recently, a member of the Indian cryptocurrency trade body &#8211; Bharat Web3 Association (BWA) &#8211; has raised its voice to the protest. It frowned on the exorbitant tax rates and the uncertainty in regulation.</p>
<p>These complaints were contained in its draft of concerns submitted to the Indian finance ministry officials. As a result, the finance ministry will be holding consultations to prepare the budget for 2023-2024.</p>
<p>Also, Bharat&#8217;s representatives and the finance ministry officials will likely meet in the coming week. The top officials expected from the Indian finance ministry for the meeting; are the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) officials.</p>
<h2>Call For Strict Regulations</h2>
<p>BWA also asked the finance ministry to implement strict regulations for the crypto sector in the wake of the FTX crisis. The body is engaging with government authorities to create stronger regulations with strict compliance.</p>
<p>BWA also stressed that the collapse of the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/18/business/ftx-crypto-downfall-explained/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>-led FTX was due to an absence of corporate governance. This governance protects traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p>Although digital asset exchanges and associations have tried to combat such recurrence, the BWA insists that strong regulations will be helpful.</p>
<h2>High Taxation Interfering With Crypto Sector Growth</h2>
<p>According to media reports, BWA has cited unfriendly tax policies as one factor &#8211; hurting the growth of the crypto business in India. BWA reckons with Coinbase, Polygon, CoinCDX, and CoinSwtich Kuber as its founding members.</p>
<p>According to a BWA <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/indian-crypto-industry-group-writes-to-govt-for-strong-regulations-122120100974_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">representative:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The BWA’s focus is to highlight the effect of the existing tax provisions, including TDS, tax on income from VDAs, and so much more. The focus of BWA hinges on regulation and the growth of the digital sector.</p></blockquote>
<p>The finance ministry earlier in the year had not only introduced the 30% capital gains tax and 1% transaction tax deduction at source (TDS). It also said profits made on crypto transactions would not be carried forward to offset losses.</p>

<p>These considerably harsh regulations have negatively impacted the crypto sector in India. Indian crypto exchanges have witnessed a massive reduction in trading volume.</p>

<p>Although TDS can be redeemed, traders do not subscribe to having their capital locked since it is not profitable. The digital asset industry representatives are clamoring for a reduction of these rates to 0.1%. The outcome of the meeting will likely have an impact on India’s crypto trade moving forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Data shows Litecoin has become the 12th largest crypto in the market after its 9% surge during the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Litecoin Continues Bullish Momentum, Registers 15% Gains In Past Week</h2>
<p>This last week has been green for much of the crypto market as many top coins have managed to get double digit gains in the period. LTC, which was already having a better time than the others, has been no different.</p>
<p>The past 24 hours or so, especially, have been great for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-rockets-up-26-24-hour-shiba-inu-market-cap/">Litecoin</a> as the crypto has risen by 9%. Following this increase, the coin&#8217;s price is now trading around $83.1.</p>
<p>Here is a chart that shows the trend in the value of LTC during the last month:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-207506 aligncenter" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-2-640x355.png" alt="Litecoin Price Chart" width="640" height="355" srcset="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-2-640x355.png 640w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-2-768x426.png 768w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-2-750x416.png 750w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-2.png 973w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
The price of the crypto seems to have sharply gone up in the last day | Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LTCUSD on TradingView</a>
<p>As you can see in the above graph, during the first third of November LTC crashed alongside the rest of the crypto market as the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/report-suggests-alameda-rescued-ftx-by-covering-1-billion-trade-loss-in-2021/">FTX exchange</a> went down.</p>
<p>However, in the final part of the month Litecoin rapidly made recovery and quickly surpassed the peak from before the crash.</p>
<p>LTC&#8217;s strength during the last month has been something extraordinary, as even giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum are still suffering from double digit losses due to the crash.</p>
<p>Overall, in the past 30 days Litecoin has accumulated profits of 23%. In terms of weekly performance, LTC has gone up by more than 15%.</p>
<h2>LTC Becomes 12th Largest Crypto By Market Cap</h2>
<p>Over the course of the past month, LTC has been steadily climbing up spots in the top crypto list, thanks to its strong strength during a period where its competitors have declined.</p>
<p>The list is based on the criteria of &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-cap-dominated-by-5-coins/">market cap</a>,&#8221; a measure of the total worth of a crypto&#8217;s entire circulating supply. Below is a table that shows where Litecoin stands in the wider market in terms of the cap size.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-207509 aligncenter" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/data-1-640x221.png" alt="Litecoin Market Cap" width="640" height="221" srcset="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/data-1-640x221.png 640w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/data-1-980x339.png 980w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/data-1-768x266.png 768w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/data-1-750x260.png 750w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/data-1-1140x395.png 1140w, https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/data-1.png 1257w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
Looks like DAI has now fallen down to the 13th spot on the list | Source: <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinMarketCap</a>
<p>It was only at the end of this October that Litecoin stood at the 20th place on this list, but since then the coin has made a massive jump of 8 spots in the span of a little more than a month.</p>
<p>The coin sitting just above LTC right now is Polkadot, which has seen some decent returns recently, but they have still been worse than LTC&#8217;s. If the crypto can keep up its recent momentum, then it may surpass DOT in the coming days, and be geared up to challenge for a spot among the top ten.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reclaims-17k-stocks-powell-speech/">Bitcoin</a> continued to make new bear market lows and has essentially failed as an inflation hedge. The ongoing recession-like macro environment has dramatically reduced the price per BTC and the share prices of top tech giants across the globe.</p>
<p>In a direct comparison with the Mark Zuckerberg-owned META, the top cryptocurrency by market cap appears to be holding up a lot better than the social media brand.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Buoys Better Than Meta During Recession Onset</h2>
<p>Bitcoin was born from the ashes of the last Great Recession. For years, investors wondered what might happen to the speculative asset class of cryptocurrencies when another recession hit, and as of this year they&#8217;ve found out.</p>
<p>Monetary tightening by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reclaims-17k-stocks-powell-speech/">the Fed</a> and rate hikes have hurt most asset prices, including the price per BTC. Once the US Federal Reserve began talking rate increases, the stock market and crypto began dropping.</p>
<p>With the two vastly different asset classes having been in a bear phase for more than a year now, there is a wealth of data available for comparison. Comparing the top cryptocurrency with some of the most important tech brands results in a jarring discover: Bitcoin is holding up better than META <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyspilotroBTC/status/1599799814270484481" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by comparison</a>.</p>
<p>META is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and other Zuck-owned brands. After making a huge bet on the metaverse, META shares have been in freefall since – with one of the steepest selloffs in all of finance.</p>

<h2>What The Zuck? Comparing Past Crypto Bear Market Drawdowns</h2>
<p>Without even measuring, it is clear that META fell much more sharply than Bitcoin with only a brief visual inspection. From peak to the current trough, both plummeted around 77% currently. What&#8217;s more notable, is the fact that META share prices fell back to 2015 levels, while cryptocurrencies are trading at the higher end of 2017 and 2018 prices.</p>
<p>But compared to past bear markets, BTC could still have a ways to go. The first ever bear market resulted in a drawdown of 94%, while the 2015 bear market took 86% off the price per coin from peak to trough. In 2018, BTC only dropped 84%, showing a trend of diminishing declines, much like returns are also diminishing.</p>
<p>The data could also infer that because volatility is reducing over time, drawdowns will get less and less severe with each subsequent bear market. What the data doesn&#8217;t explain is why META dropped so significantly compared to the speculative asset class.</p>
<p>Compared to other top cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has also came out the least battered and beaten during the bearish trend. Ethereum wiped out 82% of its face value, while metaverse tokens like Decentraland lost 94% and counting.</p>
<p>Considering BTC is holding up well against all other cryptocurrencies and even some top tech stocks, the first-ever cryptocurrency is showing more resilience than expected during its first-ever recession.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bitcoin bull Tim Draper <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/tim-draper-predicts-bitcoin-will-reach-250000-despite-ftx-collapse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended</a> his prediction on the price of the cryptocurrency. The venture capitalist and investor said the cryptocurrency would reach $250,000 by the end of 2022, but now he expects it to hit that level by mid-2023. </strong></p>
<p>This year the cryptocurrency and the crypto market lost over 80% of their value and total market capitalization. A tightening macroeconomic landscape, a hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), and high inflation triggered the decline in the price of Bitcoin. Still, Draper believes two key factors will resume the bull run. </p>

<h2>Goods News For Bitcoin, But Bad News For Altcoins?</h2>
<p>The venture capitalist is well-known in crypto for buying Bitcoin at a U.S. Marshals auction. At that time, the BTC price was hovering at around $1,000. Draper predicted that in three years, the price of the number one cryptocurrency would increase by 10-fold and reach $10,000. </p>
<p>This prophecy was fulfilled and was exceeded precisely three years later when the BTC price traded at $20,000. In an interview with CNBC, the venture capitalist said: </p>
<blockquote><p>I have extended my prediction by six months. $250k is still my number. I expect a flight to quality and decentralized crypto like bitcoin, and for some of the weaker coins to become relics.</p></blockquote>
<p>The crypto would need to overcome significant opposition to hit this number. In addition to a tightening macroeconomic environment, The collapse of trading venue FTX and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).</p>
<p>These companies’ failure has negatively affected the confidence of investors. However, Draper believes that 2023 will see buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>First, new users might jump into the market due to high inflation. Draper believes the imbalance between the number of men holding BTC versus the number of women will decrease. </p>
<p>Data provided by CNBC, according to a recent survey, indicates that 14% of men invest in digital assets versus 7% of women. The latter will invest in Bitcoin as they realize its potential to compound profits and defeat inflation. Draper said: </p>
<blockquote><p>Retailers will save roughly 2% on every purchase made in bitcoin vs dollars. Once retailers realize that that 2% can double their profits, bitcoin will be ubiquitous.</p></blockquote>
The Best Years Are Yet To Come For BTC
<p>In addition, Draper claims that the upcoming Bitcoin Halving, set for 2024, will operate as another bullish factor. In the past, this event has always preceded BTC’s next bullish cycle as the demand for the cryptocurrency declines while its supply decreases. </p>
<p>High inflation and lack of trust in the legacy financial system will fuel these two factors, Draper said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Management of fiat is centralized and erratic. When a politician decides to spend $10 trillion, your dollars become worth about 82 cents. Then the Fed needs to raise rates to make up for the spend, and those arbitrary centralized decisions create an inconsistent economy.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Genesis, the renowned crypto lender, was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/32977a99-c1c3-4f34-9ecc-4057217bf974" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> to owe close to $900 million to Gemini, a crypto exchange platform. Now, customers who have their funds locked in on Genesis have presented that Genesis now cumulatively owes $1.8 billion to Genesis&#8217; creditors.</p>
<p>The law firm Proskauer Rose represents the other group of Genesis creditors. The loans for this section of Genesis creditors have totaled $900 million. It is now being claimed that the $1.8 billion is a tentative number because the loan amount could increase.</p>
<h2>Recouping Funds From Genesis</h2>
<p>The list of companies trying to recover funds from Genesis is rising. Gemini has recently formed a creditor&#8217;s committee to regain the lost funds from the crypto lender and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).</p>
<p>Gemini formed this committee after the crypto broker was taken unawares by the crash of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX crypto group in the previous month. Additionally, Digital Currency Chief Executive Officer Barry Silbert spoke to the shareholders in October. At that time, the executive said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Venture capital company Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis Trading and cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale, owes $575 million to Genesis&#8217; crypto lending arm.</p></blockquote>
<h2 class="text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__large__nEccO body__full_width__ekUdw body__large_body__FV5_X article-body__element__2p5pI" data-testid="paragraph-1">Third Group Yet To Present Numbers</h2>
<p>The Proskauer Rose law firm has presented the number as being $1.8 billion. There is a certainty that this is not the final number. The number would increase through the ad hoc group, which is now represented by Kirkland &amp; Ellis. Ellis has also represented companies such as Celsius and Voyager Digital. Another famous law firm, Latham &amp; Wilkins, represents Gemini&#8217;s customers.</p>
<p>In its letter to the investors, which was sent last month, Genesis mentioned that it:</p>
<blockquote><p>(&#8230;) begun discussions with potential investors and our largest creditors and borrowers, including Gemini and DCG [Digital Currency Group], to agree on a solution that shores up our lending business’ overall liquidity and addresses clients’ needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the month of November, Genesis Global Capital suspended customer withdrawals on its lending platform. The reason provided was the sudden collapse of the crypto exchange platform FTX.</p>
<p>The beleaguered crypto trading platform FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in the middle of last month. The failure of FTX has been accounted for as one of the major blows to the crypto industry holistically, and it had a considerable impact on the broader market.</p>
<p>The crash had made traders take out billions from the platform in only three days. Furthermore, Binance canceled its rescue deal to buy out FTX at the last minute.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1TN is a global IT product crypto processing project developing a unique solution for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The crypto payment gateway allows users and merchants to accept crypto payments easily and has continued to onboard more users in recent months. 1TN platform allows merchants to accept multi-currency transactions without abandoning the usual benefits of traditional payment processors.</p>
<p>These developments have attracted the attention of many, so we reached out to CEO Denys Ustymenko to discuss his journey and the key features of 1TN.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Can we get to know you and your experience in the fintech industry? </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>A:</em></strong> I’m an IT entrepreneur with extensive experience in the fintech and IT industries. I had previously created products in the fintech space and, in 2016, with partners established Pokermatch, an online poker room operating in major jurisdictions worldwide.</p>
<p>As a CFO and partner, my world involved all parts of the commercial process, including marketing, business development, account management, partnership development, and performance optimization. I also created financial and legal structures in the company to ensure smooth operations.</p>
<p>Pokermatch achieved impressive growth during this period and was sold in 2021 to Parimatch Holding. After the acquisition, I decided to develop my own IT projects to help businesses grow and to build a unique platform for merchants.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q Why did you decide to move into the crypto industry?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>A:</em></strong> I have been on the side of the merchant for the last 10 years, I clearly know what problems businesses face by selling products on the internet. Some of these include issues with the conversion of payments, abandoned carts by consumers, transaction limits, and the problems connected to bank payment systems. As well, companies experience tough KYC verification issues, which has forced many merchants to adopt a strategy of ‘pay first’ before verification as seen in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Apart from these, merchants face the problem of integration having to spend high costs on IT specialists to properly install payment products on their platform. These are the reasons why I decided to develop a more convenient solution that will mitigate these problems and help businesses accept payments using a fast and reliable system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What is 1TN? </em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>A:</strong></em> 1TN is an international IT product crypto processing project. We’re currently developing a unique solution for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The headquarters is located in Portugal and we’re in the later stages of receiving a license from the National Bank of Portugal and intend to expand our operations into the Iberian market (Portugal and Spain). Our perspective plans also include the LATAM market.</p>
<p>1TN is to become the safest and most reliable cryptocurrency platform due to innovative security solutions. We’ve partnered with top IT giants like Fireblocks, Chainanalisys, and Finerymarkets to ensure top-class security and custody of users&#8217; assets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What is the value proposition of 1TN?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>A:</em></strong> 1TN offers services that can be utilized directly by e-commerce or as a white-label offering thanks to the integration options that we make available. Some of our value proposition includes</p>
<ul>
<li>Low transaction fees</li>
<li>Fast and easy setup for merchants</li>
<li>User-friendly dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Support for more than 20 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Tether.</p>
<p>Beyond this, we’ve integrated different ways in which users can send and receive payments via the web, email, smartphones, and wallet addresses. This ensures that our goals to increase financial inclusion among merchants and e-commerce is paramount. As a result, the payment landscape of our clients across the crypto-world can be extended, making cross-border transactions quicker, safer, and more convenient.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: What differentiates 1TN from other options available? </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A:</strong></em> The traditional payment system is limited for e-commerce platforms and merchants due to high transaction fees and fragmented payment channels. Cryptocurrencies provide an alternative for businesses to get full value for their services and grow their businesses beyond their locality. There is no conversion fee and merchants can buy and sell digital assets at the best possible rate on exchanges.</p>
<p>They can also get live real-time data on digital asset/fiat prices and sell with zero fees while attracting users willing to spend cryptocurrencies. 1TN offers a solution that provides these features and many more. Merchants can accept payment in fiat and buyers get the option to choose the appropriate cryptocurrency to make payments. Once the payment is completed, 1TN automatically converts it to fiat and the merchant receives the exact amount in their local currency.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What have been your biggest achievements so far with 1TN?</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>A</strong></em>: In times of turbulence, I would say launching offices and building a team of specialists with extensive experience in the crypto and fintech industries. We’ve expanded by opening three locations across Europe in Portugal, Latvia, and Bulgaria. In addition, we’re constantly working on product improvement and innovative platform development. Our main aim is to help our clients to use blockchain technology to enable speedy, secure, and low-cost payment processing services, enable third-party processors, and money transfer wait times and make cross-border payments easier.</p>
<p>This development shows that we’re on the right path toward ensuring crypto payment adoption globally.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: What are the future developments planned for 1TN? </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>A:</em></strong> We have a few products that we intend to launch in the coming months. Firstly we’ll be launching the crypto payment gateway and scaling it to help businesses grow. Our team is also ready to assist companies&#8217; growth by providing simple ways to store, accept and transfer digital assets. We also have our sights on expanding to new markets including Portugal, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, and Brazil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced founder and former Chief Executive Officer of FTX cryptocurrency exchange, appeared to have become an apologetic fellow after his company crumbled last month.</p>
<p>It can be recalled that few days after the exchange filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, SBF sent a letter to the employees of his firm expressing how &#8220;sorry&#8221; he is for making irrational decisions in the face of tremendous pressure.</p>
<p>Then, on Wednesday, through a video message, the former big boss <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-apologizes-says-didnt-try-to-commit-fraud/articleshow/95900466.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apologized again</a> for a lot of mistakes that led to the abrupt implosion of his crypto firm.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“I didn’t ever try to commit fraud on anyone. I am deeply sorry about what happened. Clearly I made a lot of mistakes or things I would be able to give anything to be able to do over again,” said Bankman-Fried during the New York Times&#8217; Dealbook conference on Nov. 30.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Not everyone though is falling for this act of the former CEO as some believe he is just preparing his defense for whatever legal battles he may face in the future.</p>

<h2><b>It Takes One To Know One? Scammer Thinks SBF Is Lying</b></h2>
<p>Anna Sorokin, the convicted scammer who made a name for herself by defrauding banks and hotels for hundreds of thousands of dollars back in 2019, claims to see through the real play of SBF.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“He’s just trying to save himself. That would be his defense if he is going to get prosecuted. You can see the seeds of that already,” </strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/anna-sorokin-delvey-sbf-media-apology-tour-scam-2022-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Sorokin</a>,<strong> referring to the claim of the FTX founder that he didn’t know that Alameda, the exchange’s trading arm, was overleveraged.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Sorokin went on to say that she believes all things that SBF tell the media right now are insincere, calling them “garbage” and are just part of a plan to cultivate an innocent image.</p>
<p>Sorokin also claims that what Bankman-Fried really did was a “Ponzi scheme,” outrightly dismissing his earlier statement of not being involved in any kind of fraudulent activity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, believes there are more than enough reasons for SBF <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-says-231208022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be taken into custody right now</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking during a crypto summit last week, Armstrong admitted he is left baffled as to why the FTX founder is still scot-free.</p>
<p>“The DOJ or somebody should be able to make &#8211; just based on his public statements, I think there’s a very open and shut case for fraud,” said the Coinbase big boss, adding that some of the people he has talked about the matter agrees with him.</p>
<p>Armstrong also took a swipe at the media for continuing to refrain from calling SBF a &#8220;criminal,&#8221; claiming that at this point in time, there is no longer a need to wait for an indictment or prosecution.</p>
